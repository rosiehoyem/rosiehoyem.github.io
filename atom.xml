    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For my third Rails app at the Flatiron School I teamed up with <a href="http://bandanakm.tumblr.com/post/63283234718/programming-in-space-ruby-meets-geolocation">Bana</a> and we set-out to learn some different geo tools and to also use one of the datasets off of NYC’s Open Data portal.<!-- more --></p>

<p>The NYC Open Data portal is powered by <a href="http://www.socrata.com/">Socrata</a>, a data technology firm out of Seattle. NYC Open Data makes the wealth of public data generated by various New York City agencies and other City organizations available for public use. The platform provides access to hundreds of datasets and comes equipt with an array of tools to make working this data easier and more accessible to wider range of technical levels.</p>

<p>We came across a <a href="http://nycdoitt.tumblr.com/post/31290798672/this-weekend-the-new-york-city-departments-of">post on the NYC ITT Tumblr</a> about a Data Kind DataDive in which they explored NYC Open Data. One of the highlighted datasets was the tree census datasets, including info on every street tree in the five boroughs of NYC. This rich data set seemed like a excellent opportunity to explore geo tools as well as NYC’s urban forest.</p>

<h3>Tools</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://www.rubygeocoder.com/">Geocoder Gem</a> proved to be a simple and effective solution to geocoding addresses. Our app includes some simple functionality to add a tree to the dataset by either A. collecting location information from a mobile device or computer, or B. by geocoding an address. There was also a great <a href="http://railscasts.com/">Railscast</a> that helped us get started.</p>

<p>We used <a href="https://cartodb.com/">CartoDB</a> to map the datasets. CartoDB handled the large number of data points with ease and created beautiful maps in no time. It easily geocoded all of the addresses, though we did run into limitations regarding the number of points the free plan would support.</p>

<iframe width='100%' height='520' frameborder='0' src='http://rosiehoyem.cartodb.com/viz/4541226e-6201-11e3-a53d-1fb48dd48efd/embed_map?title=true&description=true&search=false&shareable=false&cartodb_logo=true&layer_selector=false&legends=false&scrollwheel=true&sublayer_options=1&sql=&sw_lat=40.717055500886445&sw_lon=-74.14501190185547&ne_lat=40.822880013260004&ne_lon=-73.71620178222656'></iframe>


<p><a href="https://nycopendata.socrata.com/">Open Data NYC</a> is part of an initiative to improve the accessibility, transparency, and accountability of City government. The tree census data had already been used to explore how the City’s tree species composition changed over time, to predict where our urban forest will be most vulnerable to storms, and if programmatic maintenance reduced future citizen requests in an area such as tree pruning.</p>

<h3>Next Steps:</h3>

<p>We hope to finish up the front-end work next week after the madness of our Flatiron School experience is done and deploy to Heroku. This is an app that really needs a mobile companion. Perhaps if I’ll try my luck with Ruby Motion over the holidays.</p>

    <updated>2013-11-21T14:22:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/11/21/introducing-bucketliztr</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week we started Rails and I immediately picked up an old project idea I had started last summer while working through the Hartl Tutorial. <!-- more -->I scrapped that repository and started from scratch. It seemed like a simple little project, but quickly proved to loaded with lots of small challenges.</p>

<h3>Features</h3>

<p>The beta version includes only the basic ability to create a bucket list. No bells and whistles (yet!). The site includes a simple data model with only two models and one controller.</p>

<p><a href="">Railscasts</a> are awesome and were a huge help during this project. Ryan Bates has covered hundreds of topics in clear concise little screencasts accompanied by succinct code. These little bite-size rails bits make the building of our a few different features of this site much easier, including the nested form, the mailer, and the soon to be deployed authentication system.</p>

<p>This was my first try at <a href="http://railscasts.com/episodes/196-nested-model-form-revised">nested forms</a>. I decided to implement the new user and new bucket list form in the same view. I also got a bit of practice with jQuery to dynamically render a new bucket list item partial.</p>

<p>With the help of <a href="http://vicfriedman.github.io/">Victoria Friedman</a>, another Flatiron alum who visited the school last Saturday, I was able to work with Active Mailer to set-up a confirmation e-mail.</p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

<p>This was also my first try at using a downloaded bootstrap theme for the front end styling. I, of course, chose a crazy <a href="https://wrapbootstrap.com/">Wrap Bootstrap</a> theme completed jazzed out with paralax. It probably would have worked fine if I hadn’t wanted to customize it. As soon as I started chopping up the index page, it broke. Surprise surprise. So this means I also got an intimate look at the workings of a complex CSS/JS template. It was a learning experience indeed.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Honestly, I haven’t loved learning to program. I LOVE Rails though, and as a result, I think I am enjoying the nuts and bolts of programming more as well. <!-- more -->I’ve been thinking about why this could be, and I’ve come to the conclusion that Rails is a closer match for how my brain has been trained to work. It is designed at a higher level of abstraction that can more easily be related to things that I do understand in the real world. Let me explain via the example of the city interpretted as a model, view, and controller.</p>

<h4>Model</h4>

<p>The model of city could be compared to the laws. We are a society shaped by laws. They govern how we build (building codes), how we move through the city (traffic laws), how we relate to each other, etc.  Just a like a program that throws errors when you disobey the rules in the model, we punish citizens for breaking the law by issuing violations and putting people in prison. Just like our models, laws are a deliberate design element of our society that shape the ideal world we would like to live in and they can change.</p>

<h4>View</h4>

<p>The view of a city, the interface if you will, is the city itself. Just like for a user of software, the interface is the program. Our experience of both a city and a website is what we see, touch, and interact with. We know there are laws written down somewhere and people who deal with these things (lawyers, judges, and politicians), but, for the vast majority of us, we don’t really think about it.</p>

<p>Architects are like front end developers. They create the built environment we see around us. They must follow the rules though. They also think about how citizens interact with interface.</p>

<h4>Controller</h4>

<p>The controller is like the verb of the city. It is how a person navigates the city to go from their home to work to a bar and back home. At first I had a hard thinking about a parallel structure in the city that plays the same role as the controller, then it kind of dawned on me… What in society allows us to navigate activate views and create resources… For better or worse, the only thing I could think of was currency. I don’t mean currency in strict sense of money. Currency can come in many forms, but we</p>

<p>Now, why I love rails.</p>

<p>A few years ago I read What Technology Wants. This new theory of technology offers three practical lessons:
1. By listening to what technology wants we can better prepare ourselves and our children for the inevitable technologies to come.
2. By adopting the principles of pro-action and engagement, we can steer technologies into their best roles.
3. And by aligning ourselves with the long-term imperatives of this near-living system, we can capture its full gifts.</p>

<p>The moral of the story is that when I look at rails, I see an elegant synthesis of human creations, which is exactly what I see when I look at the city. Rails is a continuation of everything that has come before. Rails is an elegant synthesis of many parts, many technologies, the fruits of many brilliant minds. It is layered and complex and seems to be a living, breathing extension of everyone who has worked on it.</p>

<p>For me, technology gets really interesting when the lines between different disciplines dissolve and we come to the realization we are all talking about the same thing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re now into week 8 at the Flatiron School and for the last couple of days we were thrown head-first into Javascript. <!-- more -->This is my ‘Cliff Note’ version of what we covered and my guide for continuing study over the coming weeks and months. Might be a helpful guide for others as well?</p>

<h2>A Few Good Block Posts on Learning Javascript From People Who Know</h2>

<p><em><a href="http://javascriptissexy.com/how-to-learn-javascript-properly/">How to Learn Javascript Properly</a>
</em><a href="http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/">A Baseline for Front-End Developers</a>
&hellip;I think we’re seeing the emphasis shift from valuing trivia to valuing tools.</p>

<h2>On-line Basic Tutorials</h2>

<p><em><a href="https://www.codeschool.com/paths/javascript">Code School Javascript Path</a>
</em><a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript">Codecademy Javascript Track</a></p>

<h2>What to Start With? (Advice From a Guest Speaker)</h2>

<ol>
<li>Javascript basics</li>
<li>jQuery (DOM manipulation)</li>
<li>Underscore (How to think about using objects in the browser)</li>
<li>Frameworks: Ember/Backbone</li>
</ol>


<p>When to use jQuery vs. core Javascript: Use JQuery is for interacting with the DOM. Use core javascript for declaring variables, etc.</p>

<h2>The Resource of Choice (“The fine manual”)</h2>

<p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/">Mozillia Developer Network</a>
Alas, there is no manual for front-end development, but this comes pretty close. Good front-end devs know to prefix any search engine query with mdn – for example, mdn javascript arrays – in order to avoid the for-profit plague that is w3schools.</p>

<em>In Browser Dev Tools
</em>Source URLs
<em>Source Maps

<h2>Templating Tools</h2>

<p><a href="http://garann.github.io/template-chooser/">Template Chooser</a></p>

<h2>Frameworks</h2>

<p><a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>
<a href="http://emberjs.com/">Ember</a>
<a href="http://angularjs.org/">Angular</a></p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14395887/what-are-benefits-of-using-backbone-js-vs-ember-js-vs-angular-js">Lots of talk about which to use… </a></p>

<h2>More Advanced Javascript Tools</h2>

<p><a href="http://bower.io/">Bower</a> is a package manager for the web. It offers a generic, unopinionated solution to the problem of front-end package management, while exposing the package dependency model via an API that can be consumed by a more opinionated build stack.</p>

<p>Bower is dependent on Node. Node.js is a platform built on Chrome&rsquo;s JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices. <a href="http://dev.af83.com/2013/01/02/managing-rails-assets-with-bower.html">We can also Manage Rails Assets with Bower</a></p>

<p><a href="http://www.jshint.com/">JSHint</a> is a tool that helps to detect errors and potential problems in your JavaScript code. The goal of this project is to help JavaScript developers write complex programs without worrying about typos and language gotchas.</p>

<p><a href="http://requirejs.org/">RequireJS</a> is a JavaScript file and module loader. It is optimized for in-browser use, but it can be used in other JavaScript environments, like Rhino and Node. Using a modular script loader like RequireJS will improve the speed and quality of your code.</p>

<p><a href="http://underscorejs.org/">Underscore JS</a> is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot of the functional programming support that you would expect in <a href="http://prototypejs.org/">Prototype.js</a> (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in JavaScript objects. “It&rsquo;s the tie to go along with jQuery&rsquo;s tux, and Backbone.js&rsquo;s suspenders.” (ha, cute.)</p>

<p>Underscore provides 80-odd functions that support both the usual functional suspects:map, select, invoke — as well as more specialized helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality testing, and so on. It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map, reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/event_on.asp">jQuery’s On</a> + <a href="http://paularmstrong.github.io/swig/">SWIG Templates</a>
The on() method attaches one or more event handlers for the selected elements and child elements. SWIG is simple, powerful, and extendable JavaScript Template Engine.</p>

    <updated>2013-10-31T11:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/31/testing-the-missing-cliff-notes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We started working with tests at the Flatiron School in week two. Every week tests have grown in complexity and we&rsquo;ve encorporated new tools into our repetoir. <!-- more -->We are now we&rsquo;re now in our 6th week and I decided it was time to break it down and do a full inventory of tools. This more for my own benefit than the world at large, but maybe others will find it useful also.</p>

<h2>What is testing?</h2>

<p>Software testing is an investigation conducted to provide stakeholders with information about the quality of the product or service under test. (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_testing">Thanks Wikipedia</a>). Even more than this simple definition, we do (Test Driven Development (TDD))[<a href="http://ruby.about.com/od/advancedruby/a/tdd.htm">http://ruby.about.com/od/advancedruby/a/tdd.htm</a>], which means we write our tests before we write out code, then write code to pass the tests. This, of course, mean that tests are very important to development to sucess of writing quality software. First, lets zoom way out to get some larger context from the industry (Rubiests didn&rsquo;t invent testing, of course.) We&rsquo;ll then drill down into the specifics of how testing is used in Ruby and some of the most common tools.</p>

<h2>Software Testing in General</h2>

<p>At Flatiron we dove straight into working with tests without delving into much of the theory surrounding testing. For a bit of context, the industry will often refer to testing as White Box, Black Box, Gray Box or Visual Testing.</p>

<p><em>White Box Testing</em>: White-box testing (also known as clear box testing, glass box testing, transparent box testing and structural testing) tests internal structures or workings of a program, as opposed to the functionality exposed to the end-user. In white-box testing an internal perspective of the system, as well as programming skills, are used to design test cases.</p>

<p><em>Black Box Testing</em>: A method of software testing that examines the functionality of an application (e.g. what the software does) without peering into its internal structures or workings.</p>

<p><em>Gray Box Testing</em>: Is a combination of white-box testing and black-box testing. The aim of this testing is to search for the defects if any due to improper structure or improper usage of applications.</p>

<h3>Levels of Testing</h3>

<ol>
<li>Unit tests</li>
<li>Feature / integration tests</li>
<li>Visual testing</li>
<li>Others&hellip;</li>
</ol>


<p>Unit Testing: Tests basically just a Ruby class.
*i.e., controller tests that use a fake htp request to test functionality.</p>

<p>Integration Testing (Feature Testing)
*Starts up a real web server and runs through actual motions of the program. Actually completes the edits, etc. that are occuring on the site being tested. Typical techniques for this are either using stubs/drivers or execution from a debugger environment.</p>

<p>Top-down and Bottom-up Testing (at the Flatiron, we&rsquo;ve also talked about this as Inside-out or Outside-in testing).</p>

<h2>Tools Galore!</h2>

<p>Rubiests love to test and holy buckets have they created every imaginable tool to make the process easier, more though, more susscint, more verbose and colloquial&hellip; You name. There is a probably a tool that will help you do it.</p>

<p>Considering the different levels of programming, these are a few tools that we have discussed so far or that I have stumbled upon on my own. This list is far from exhaustive.</p>

<h3>Rspec</h3>

<p>Rspec is what we learn here at the Flatiron School and the testing suite of choice for most ruby developers. It comes equipt with it&rsquo;s own DSL or domain specific language for completing the task of writing tests for your code.</p>

<p>The basic components of an Rspec
• The model’s create method, when passed valid attributes, should be valid.
• Data that fail validations should not be valid.
• Class and instance methods perform as expected.</p>

<p>It describes a set of expectations–in this case, what the Contact model should look like.
• Each example (a line beginning with it) only expects one thing and starts with a verb.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.relishapp.com/rspec/rspec-expectations/docs">Rspec expectations</a>: Outlines the preferred format for Rspec tests as of the last version.</p>

    <link href="http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/30/naming-the-world/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-30T11:39:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/30/naming-the-world</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We&rsquo;re coming up on National write a Novel Month. In November you can join thousands of aspiring writers from around the country for National Novel Writing Month (NaNoWriMo). <!-- more --> This event involves writing 1,800 words a day, which after 30 days, will equal the length as a respectable novel. My attempt to log 50,000 words last year was thwarted by a nasty flu in week two that set me hopelessly behind on my word count and work (that&rsquo;s my excuse and I&rsquo;m sticking to it), but NaNoWriMo and I will meet again!</p>

<p>NaNoWri was founded to make a point about writing; the difference between a good writer and a great writer that you may have heard of is largely the number of words a person logs everyday. Sucessful writers write a lot.</p>

<p>The next measure of a great writer vs. a good writer is the quality of the details&mdash;are they true and believeable? Do they contribute to building the story? Language is a dynamic thing, and the art of picking the right word for the right ocassion and expressing ideas clearly is both a skill that comes with experience and an art. I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot about writing as I learn how to program.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been reading a lot because I spend nearly two hours a day on the train. My current train reading is Jeff Atwood&rsquo;s Effective Programming: More Than Writing Code (<a href="http://www.hyperink.com/Effective-Programming-More-Than-Writing-Code-b1559">Get your copy here!</a>). He is the master mind behind the <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/">Coding Horror Blog</a> and also co-founded Stack Overflow. In the chapter entitled &lsquo;How to Write Without Writing&rsquo; he emphasizes how important it is for programmers to have good writing and communication skills. I found it quite amusing that he claims part of the reason he founded Stack Overflow was to &ldquo;trick&rdquo; programers into writing. Writing about code forces programmers to communicate more clearly about what they are doing and why.</p>

<p>Writing, clear communication skills, picking works appropriatelly are all important skills for programmers. I want to hit a few relevant topics for programmers that demonstrate this point.</p>

<h2>Naming Things Well</h2>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are two hard things in computer science: cache invalidation, naming things, and off-by-one errors.&rdquo;
<a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html">Martin Fowler</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Part of clear communcation in code is naming things well. The names programmers give to variables and methods in their programs matter. Naming things is often sited as one of the most difficult aspects of programing to do well. Jeff&rsquo;s Attwood&rsquo;s post <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2006/03/i-shall-call-it-somethingmanager.html">I Shall Call It.. SomethingManager</a> lays out several very important reasons why naming things well <em>really</em> matters in programming.</p>

<p>For one, carfully paying attention to naming things clearly and concisely simply makes your program better. It helps to provide better understanding in the future should your code reused after a long interval of time. It not only makes it easier to read through code and understanding what is going on, it is perhaps low hanging fruit for newbies to attain the professional appearance of work product. It may seem funny in the moment to use cute or comical names. Don&rsquo;t do it. Overly long names or single letter variables also make code more difficult to understand. <a href="http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/post/26561881517/text-single-letter-variables-who-the-fuck-do">Don&rsquo;t do it.</a></p>

<p>Naming things well can also act as a form of metadata for your program. If you feel like you need comments, reconsider how you&rsquo;ve used names for your variables and methods in your code. Comments shouldn&rsquo;t need to explain what a piece of code is doing, they should be used sparingly only to describe <em>why</em> you&rsquo;ve constructed your code the way you have. Use clear and consistent names to promote consistency within a project and on a development team. Everyone&rsquo;s productivity will benefit.</p>

<h2>Naming Conventions that Make Rack Frameworks Work</h2>

<p>Beyond the somewhat subjective benefits of making our code more clear and concise, the most popular Ruby Frameworks, including Sinatra and Rails, are constructed around a variety of naming conventions. Not abiding by these conventions will make your programs not work. When working with ruby frameworks</p>

<p>Just last week my group found this out the hard way. When naming a Sequel table we used <code>candy</code> for our <code>class Candy</code> rather than <code>candies</code>. <a href="http://theprofoundprogrammer.com/post/55025985936/text-have-you-ever-heard-of-naming-conventions">This didn&rsquo;t seem like a major difference&hellip; ?</a> Low and behold, Sequal would not recognize our table because it was looking for the exact plural of our class.</p>

<p>These strict naming conventions will only become more important as we move into Active Record and Rails. Attention to these seemingly small details will be the difference between a things working and not.</p>

<h2>Namespaces</h2>

<p>The idea of namespaces is a broader topic in programming that also amplifies the importance of choosing names well and communicating clearly to the surrounding context. A namespace is a defined area or domain for a set of identifiers or names. Namespaces allows the disambiguation of homonym identifiers residing in different namespaces. Namespaces usually group names based on their functionality, so it is possible to do an endless number of things with limited sets of words.</p>

<h3>In Summary.</h3>

<p>Programming has more in common with creative writing than most would guess. The careful use of words to describe the world around us and inside our programs will make both work better.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here are a few of the highlights from this week&rsquo;s blog posts from Flatiron students.<!-- more --></p>

<p>Anders&rsquo;s post, <a href="http://coderchronicles.org/2013/10/20/what-i-learned-from-shipping-my-first-ruby-gem/">What I Learned from Shipping my First Gem</a>, was an interesting chromical of his experience creating his first gem. This past weekend Sonja and Charlotte and I shipped our first gem, so it was interesting to hear someone else&rsquo;s experience also. Anders created a simple weather gem to get a super basic weather report at the command line. Check it out: [Simple Forcast[(<a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/simple_forecast">https://rubygems.org/gems/simple_forecast</a>)</p>

<p>Another interesting bit that came from our disucssion was the immense utility of another gem, Chronic](<a href="http://chronic.rubyforge.org/">http://chronic.rubyforge.org/</a>)</p>

<p><a href="http://danielchangnyc.github.io/">Daniel Chang</a>
I had to include Daniel&rsquo;s post on <a href="http://danielchangnyc.github.io/blog/2013/10/23/throw-raise/">Ruby Exceptions</a> because these are things that have been confusing me as of lately. Not any more!</p>

<p>And a quick honable mention for <a href="http://manleyhimself.tumblr.com/">Manley&rsquo;s</a> post on <a href="http://manleyhimself.tumblr.com/">Bash Shortcuts</a>.</p>

<p>Thursday during the Flatiron Presents, <a href="http://polycarpou.github.io/">Michael Polycarpou</a>presented the Breadth First Algorithm. Along with being a fantastic presentation that brought together several different concepts from computing. Avi pointed out that many of the classic algorithms, including the Breadth First Alforithm, can be found on the <a href="http://bigocheatsheet.com/">Big O Cheat Sheet</a>. Not sure what I&rsquo;ll do with it, but taking note for a future day when I&rsquo;m more awesome&hellip; and know what to do with a fancy algorithm.</p>

<p>The other group from Thursday&rsquo;s Flatiron Presents created a fun movie app using Google&rsquo;s <a href="https://developers.google.com/freebase/">Freebase API</a> (page also includes a  nice intro video presentation). I had no idea this existed and&hellip; wow. This appears to be a powerful tool. I look forward to playing with it more when project-mode kicks in.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I passed a huge milestone in my Ruby career this weekend. I published my first gem. <!-- more --></p>

<p>First let me issue the disclaimer that it really isn&rsquo;t anything to get excited about. It is my first contribution to the world of ruby.</p>

<p>It is called <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/chillax">Chillax</a>. We went through and scraped some inspirational sayings from some twitter pages. The gem spits out a random quote when you type &lsquo;chillax&rsquo; into the terminal. Not super useful for anything and the code behind the gem is not complicated. We also already found bug that will need to be fixed in version 0.0.2.</p>

<p>It was fun though and it made all three of us feel like we have really gotten somewhere in the past four weeks. WE MADE A GEM! We are now not only users of open source software, we are contributors. In some ways it felt like out initiation. We&rsquo;re in and this is just the beginning.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Here at the Flatiron School we are encouraged to actively blog. We are also required to present one blog post every two weeks to the group. So much interesting stuff has been coming from my classmates, I decided to do a weekly round-up of some of my favorite posts. <!-- more -->Here are handful of interesting posts from the past week:</p>

<p><a href="http://glamouracademy.github.io/">Charlote Chang</a> blew us away with a fun little blog &lsquo;presentation&rsquo; mixing variable scope and health care politics. Her post, <a href="http://glamouracademy.github.io/blog/2013/10/16/variable-scope-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-ruling-class/">Variable Scope: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Ruling Class</a>, is entertaining and informative not mention beautifully designed.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/">Trevor McKendrick&rsquo;s</a> last post <a href="http://www.trevormckendrick.com/10-ruby-tricks/">10 Ruby Tricks</a> is nice list of new Ruby bits that I hope to incorporate into my coding immediately. How logical to set default attribute accessors with an attr_accessor_with_default method! And using the &lsquo;-c&rsquo; flat to check the syntax of ruby code without running it&mdash;brilliant.</p>

<p><a href="http://ahimmelstoss.github.io/">Amanda Himelstoss&rsquo;s</a> post <a href="http://ahimmelstoss.github.io/blog/2013/10/11/using-the-mail-gem-and-launchd-to-make-a-newsletter/">Using the Mail Gem and Launchd to Make a Newsletter</a> was a great introduction to a handy little gem, the <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/mail">Mail Gem</a>, and also a little primer on an aspect of my computer that I haven&rsquo;t explored much, Launchd. When time allows, I hope to make a little app like this collect relevant posts on a particular topic I am interested in.</p>

<p><a href="http://emilyxxie.github.io">Emily Xie&rsquo;s</a> latest post on <a href="http://emilyxxie.github.io/blog/2013/10/14/dynamc-dispatch-101/">Dynamic Dispath</a> was a nice run down of one of the coolest sounding metaprogramming conepts we have covered, <em>Dynamic Dispatch!</em> It feels like you need to shout it. Emily gives some nice examples of how Dynamic Dispatch can be used to write cleaner code.</p>

<p>Last, but not least a few of my classmates made a fun Name Game app and <a href="http://theevo.github.io/blog/2013/10/16/name-game-takeaways/">Theo&rsquo;s post</a> runs down how they did it and few things they learned. Four weeks into the program, it is a bit embarrassing to not know someone&rsquo;s name, so this was a great tool to fill in those last few gaps. It was also great to learn about <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Project Pages</a>. I need to start thinking of some fun apps to publish.</p>

    <link href="http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/17/refactoring-case-statements-and-recycling/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-17T16:10:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/17/refactoring-case-statements-and-recycling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You know what stinks? Trash. You know what stinks less? Well organized trash in tidy bins.</p>

<p>Code smells can also arise from long methods in poorly organized classes. <!-- more -->Have you ever walked-up to a waste receptacle and been totally confused by which bin to throw your item in? Just like how you don’t want to stand in front of the trash bin and read complicated instructions about how to throw away your sandwich container, you don’t want to create a lot of overly complicated logic piled into one class when you are programming because this is hard to communicate to other people who may read your code. It it is also more likely to break in the future.</p>

<p>You want your classes to only do one thing and you want your methods short and sweet. We are going to practice refactoring a confusing ‘Recycle’ class to demonstrate. Here’s a hypothetical program for throwing a piece of trash into the Big Belly Solar trash bins:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/rosiehoyem/7017970.js"></script>


<p>The instructions on the trash bins are probably correct, they are just confusing. Let’s improve the design of how we communicate this logic.</p>

<p>In their book, Refactoring, Jay Fields, Shane Harvie, Martin Fowler, and Kent Beck  have several suggestions for tackling bloated classes and long, complicated methods. The example above purposely contains a case statement. Truth be told, I didn’t realize that case statements were a code smell until reading this book. In OO programming, case statements are are one of the most obvious code smells. There are several strategies for simplifying case and if/else statements to make their functionality more clear and the code less susceptible to breaking in the future.</p>

<p>The first step that should be taken when refactoring is to be a solid set of tests for the bit of code that will be tackled.</p>

<p>One solution could include Polymorphism. This essentially means that the new code would allow you to avoid writing an explicit conditional when you have objects whose behavior varies depending on their types. In Ruby this can be achieved  by implementing the same method signature on multiple objects and calling these methods polymorphically.</p>

<p>Steps:
1. If the conditional statement is one part of larger method, take apart the conditional statement and use Extract Method.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>If necessary use Move Method to place the conditional at the appropriate place in the object structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Pick on of the polymorphic objects. Create a method on the polymorphic object that will override the conditional statement method. Copy the body of that leg of the conditional statement in the polymorphic method and adjust to fit.</p></li>
<li><p>Test.</p></li>
<li><p>Remove the copied leg of the conditional statement</p></li>
<li><p>Test.</p></li>
<li><p>Repeat with each leg of the conditional statement until all legs are turned into polymorphic methods.</p></li>
</ol>


<script src="https://gist.github.com/rosiehoyem/7023062.js"></script>


<p>*Long Methods are BAD. Refactor them.
In summary, the least stinky and longest lived object programs are those with short methods. Just like how you hate decoding instructions on recycling bins, since the early days of programming people have realized that the longer a procedure is, the more difficult it is to understand and more likely it is to break. The net effect is that you should be much more aggressive about decomposing methods.</p>

<p>Ninety-nine percent of the time, all you have to do to shorten a method is Extract Method. Find parts of the method that seem to go nicely together and make a new method.</p>

<p>Polymorphism can also bring with it many advantages when the same set of conditions appear in many places in the program. If you want to add a new type, you have to find and update all the conditionals. But with polymorphism, you just create a new class and provide the appropriate methods.
Clients of the class don’t need to know about the polymorphism, which reduces the dependencies in your system and make it easier to update.</p>

    <id>http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/15/code-smells-and-waste-management</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Have you ever walked down the street and stared in wonder at the hussel and bussel of everyone in cars and taxis, on bikes, and on foot gets to where they need to go?<!-- more --></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been making my way through Refactoring by Jay Fields, et al. They cover a laundry list of different ways code smells can inform how to refactor your code. A few which I will cover in the following posts include:</p>

<p>Duplicate Code: Number one in the stink parade is duplicated code. If you see the same code structure in more than one place, you can be sure that your program will be better if you find a way to unify them. The simplest duplicated code problem is when you have the same expression in two methods of the same class. Then all you have to do is Extract Method and invoke the code from both places.</p>

<p>Long Methods: The object programs that live best and longest are those with short methods. Programmers new to objects often feel that no computation ever takes place, that object programs are endless sequences of delegation. When you have lived with such a program for a few years, however, you learn just how valuable all those little methods are.</p>

<p>Large Classes: When a class is trying to do too much, it often shows up as too many instance variables. When a class has too many instance variables, duplicated code cannot be far behind.</p>

<p>Long Parameter Lists: In our early programming days we were taught to pass in as parameters everything needed by a routine. This was understandable because the alternative was global data, and global data is evil and usually painful. Objects change this situation because if you don&rsquo;t have something you need, you can always ask another object to get it for you. Thus with objects you don&rsquo;t pass in everything the method needs; instead you pass enough so that the method can get to everything it needs.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Thursdays the Flatiron School has an open house and invites perspective students, former students, and other members of the tech community to come and see what we are up to. <!-- more -->To prepare for this event, our group was randomly divided up into groups of four and assigned to present one week during the next 10 weeks of the program. I had the honor and privilege of getting to go first.</p>

<p>Our group decided to draw on work from <a href="http://www.poodr.com/">&ldquo;Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a>(POODR) by Sandi Metz. The book came out in late 2012 and has been the topic of much conversation within the Ruby community.</p>

<p>Sandi Metz&rsquo;s book has been a great introduction to OOD. She writes in a simple and down-to-earth voice and draws on 30 years of experience. Much of her advice comes from perspective of someone who has been writing code and maintaining this same code for years. Her perspective on good OOD comes from a long-view perspective.</p>

<p>While doing research for this presentation, I stumbled across an episode of the <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/087-rr-book-clubpractical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby-with-sandi-metz/">Ruby Rogues podcast (Episode 87)</a> where they do an in-depth interview with Sandi Metz about the book. She offers many interesting tidbits about her motivation for writing the book, her process, as well as her intended audience.</p>

<p>Metz intended the book to provide solid guidance for novice programmers. For myself, her matter-of-fact advice was welcomed and bit refreshing. Ruby, as a language with many methods that do the same thing and many different ways to solve the same problem, allows for immense creativity and individual style, but this freedom can intimidating for a novice who doesn&rsquo;t have the experience programming or a deep understanding of the broader context in which the code will be living to choose the best design strategy.</p>

<p>Last week I wrote a post on SOLID Object-Oriented Design. My presentation on Thursday also elaborated on another set of rules Sandi Metz defines for novice programmers.</p>

<ol>
<li>Classes can be no longer than 100 lines of code.</li>
<li>Methods can be no longer than 5 lines of code.</li>
<li>Pass no more than 4 parameters into a method. Hash options are parameters.</li>
<li>Controllers can instantiate only one object. Therefore, views can only know about one instance variable and views should only send messages to that object (@object.collaborator.value is not allowed).</li>
</ol>


<p>During the interview with Sandi on Ruby Rogues, she suggests that novice programmers should follow the rules until you hate them. Only break the rules if and when you are able to fully explain why you need to break them.</p>

<p>All were in agreement that the first evening of Thursday presentations went well.</p>

<p>SOLID. We want our code to be <a title="SOLID Wikipedia page" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design)" target="_blank">SOLID</a>. What does this mean?</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>Sandi Metz&rsquo;s presentation <a title="Speaker Deck presentation: Solid Object Oriented Design" href="https://speakerdeck.com/skmetz/solid-object-oriented-design" target="_blank">SOLID Object-Oriented Design</a> outlines the pitfalls of letting software grow without careful attention to design and constant refactoring. The presentation dives into an example of a simple application consisting of a handful of classes. She skillfully shows how it can be streamlined with increased abstraction, thus lessening the chances that future changes will break the code.</p>

<p>I also recently picked-up a copy of <a title="Sandi Metz" href="http://www.sandimetz.com/" target="_blank">Sandi Metz&rsquo;s Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby</a>. The first chapter introduces the principles of SOLID, the foundation of the rest of the book. As a newbie programmer, this seems like a fairly important idea to internalize, so here we go.</p>

<p>In computer programming, SOLID is a mnemonic acronym capturing the ideas of Single responsibility, Open-closed, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation and Dependency inversion. It was originally introduced by Michael Feathers for the &ldquo;first five principles&rdquo; identified by Robert C. Martin in the early 2000s that stands for five basic principles of object-oriented programming and design.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">S</span>ingle Responsibility</strong>: A class should have one and only one responsibility.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">O</span>pen-closed</strong>: Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">L</span>iskov Substitution</strong>: Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program. (This particular definition of a subtyping relation, called <em>(strong) behavioral subtyping,</em> was initially introduced by <a title="Barbara Liskov" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbara_Liskov" target="_blank">Barbara Liskov</a>, hence the name.)</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I</span>nterface Segregation</strong>: Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">D</span>ependency Inversion Principle</strong>: Software design should depend upon abstractions, not upon concretions.</p>

<p>SOLID is perhaps the most basic and foundational aspects of successful OO software design and development. The goal of these principles is to create a system that is easy to maintain and extend over time&mdash;a critical aspect of successful applications.</p>

    <link href="http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/06/week-two-the-cult-of-ruby/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-06T16:07:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/06/week-two-the-cult-of-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow and exclude people, so create.”
~_Why the Lucky Stiff</p></p></blockquote>

<p>We covered <em>Why the Lucky Still this past week during our developer of the day. <!-- more --></em>Why is notorious in the Ruby community. He was a brilliant developer and prolific contributor in the early days, then about three years ago, he commit digital suicide and completely erased his presence on-line. Most of his stuff still exists in various locations on the internet and he has achieved legend status. His writing style is quirky to say the least and full of little scrawled cartoons. He paints a picture of Ruby as being something other than the run-of-mill language. This is the message many of the languages originators and most active practitioners communicate.</p>

<p>At the end of last week we covered Yukihiro Matsumoto aka Matz. Matz says he created Ruby to make programmers happy, and designed it to be expressive. He is a famously nice guy, so much so that the Ruby community has adopted the saying MINSWAN, or: Matz Is Nice So We Are Nice.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t only conclude that I am being initiated into a cult. It is the best kind of cult&mdash;one composed of smart creators who are nice.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve spent heaps of time on Ruby this past week and most of it has been frustrating, but kind of fun. It has been frustrating because I am rewiring my brain. It is a totally different way of thinking and the best way I can describe it is by comparing it to learning a foreign language. I remember days when I was totally immersed in spanish when my brain hurt. Slowly though, almost without me noticing at first, my brain reorganized itself. It was more than a process of learning a bunch of facts about vocabulary and grammar, it changed me.</p>

<p>During our Feeling Friday (and hour at the end of the day on Friday when we sit in a circle and talk about how we were feeling about the week) many members of my class described how they were now dreaming in Ruby. This is a sign that the brain is being changed, our though processes are being effected in ways we probably can&rsquo;t begin to comprehend after only two weeks.</p>

<p>Ruby is a way of thinking, a way of working, and a way of being. Soon we all be card-carrying cult members. I look forward to it.</p>

    <link href="http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/04/regex-and-other-funny-looking-things-in-ruby/"/>
    <updated>2013-10-04T16:06:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://rosiehoyem.github.io/blog/2013/10/04/regex-and-other-funny-looking-things-in-ruby</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I just finished my second week at the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a>. This week we&rsquo;ve continued to plow through Ruby. It&rsquo;s fun, but kind of makes my brain hurt.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>We&rsquo;ve covered strings, arrays, hashes, symbols, how to create new methods, and started diving into object oriented programming.</p>

<p>Ruby is remarkably, syntactically clear. It isn&rsquo;t quite like spoken language, but unlike many computer languages (so I hear), it isn&rsquo;t complete computer gibberish. I guess this is why so many people love it. There are several things that have been making my head hurt that look nothing like normal English and don&rsquo;t reveal their meaning at all by just looking at them. They are strange little arrangements of letters and punctuation marks that just look funny in the nice flow of clear Ruby expression (sorry Ruby, they look like gibberish). Apparently they are an important part of the language though, so here is my attempt to explain them.</p>

<h2>Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>The first time I can across a regular expression, it was in a classmates code solution to one of our assignments. At first I was taken aback how much shorter his solution was than mine, then I was like what in the blip-itty-blip is that thing? Enter regular expressions.</p>

<p>A regular expression is a special sequence of characters that helps you match or find other strings or sets of strings, using a specialized syntax held in a pattern.</p>

<p>Some of the most important String methods that use regular expressions are sub and gsub, and their in-place variants sub! and gsub!. These methods perform a search-and-replace operation using a Regexp pattern. <em>Note</em> the sub &amp; sub! replace the first occurrence of the pattern and gsub &amp; gsub! replace all occurrences. <em>Double note</em> The sub and gsub return a new string, leaving the original unmodified where as sub! and gsub! modify the string on which they are called.</p>

<p>They can be confusing. Rubular is great tool to test what regular expressions can do. This site also contains a nice little table to guide you as you create your expression (cheat sheet&mdash;awesome).</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be stupid. Use this tool wisely. A suggestion for how not to use  Regular Expressions here.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ll use regular expressions.&rdquo; Now they have two problems.
&mdash; Jamie Zawinski</p></blockquote>

<h2>String Literals</h2>

<p>Next up! String literals.</p>

<p>String expressions begin and end with double or single quote marks. Double-quoted string expressions are subject to backslash escape and expression substitution. Single-quoted strings are not (except for \&lsquo; and \).</p>

<p>The string expressions begin with % are the special form to avoid putting too many backslashes into quoted strings. The %q/STRING/ expression is the generalized single quote. The %Q/STRING/ (or %/STRING/) expression is the generalized double quote. Any non-alphanumeric delimiter can be used in place of /, including newline. If the delimiter is an opening bracket or parenthesis, the final delimiter will be the corresponding closing bracket or parenthesis. (Embedded occurrences of the closing bracket need to be backslashed as usual.)</p>

<p>Backslash notation</p>

<p>\t   tab(0x09)
\n   newline(0x0a)
\r   carriage return(0x0d)
\f   form feed(0x0c)
\b   backspace(0x08)
\a   bell(0x07)
\e   escape(0x1b)
\s   whitespace(0x20)
\nnn   character in octal value nnn
\xnn   character in hexadecimal value nn
\cx   control x
\C-x   control x
\M-x   meta x (c | 0x80)
\M-\C-x   meta control x
\x   character x itself</p>

<p>The string literal expression yields new string object each time it evaluated.</p>

<h2>Splat! *</h2>

<p>Splat? Eh?</p>

<p>The asterisk operator that we affectionately call the splat can have several uses.</p>

<p>I quit my job, uprooted my life (again) to relocate to NYC, and am now spending most of my waking life staring at my computer. <!-- more -->I have a masters degree from an Ivy League institution and I had a career. Why did I drop everything to learn how to program? Why am I at the Flatiron School?</p>

<p>I care really deeply about making the world a better place. I fear I care so much and have spent so much of the l</p>

<p>There are so many problems to solve and so many different ways to solve them. I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of the last 10 years looking for the best approach to solving these big problems. I&rsquo;ve collected bits of many many skill-sets from areas such as design, policy, finance, and business in attempts at understanding more clearly what is the crux of these problems and how will they be best solved. For better or worse, this has made me the jack of all trades, master of none.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve gained enough experience and perspective in the world at this point to understand for one, what I like to do and what I&rsquo;ll be good at, as well as what skill-sets are most effective at solving problems.</p>

<p>That is why I&rsquo;m learning to program. As far as I can tell, and this is not an guess, I think by learning to program I&rsquo;ll have the most impact possible on the world. I feel strongly about this and I&rsquo;m really excite to build stuff that solves problems.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m also learning to program because I want to be a part of a world eats and breaths innovation. I&rsquo;ve had the feeling over the past few years that the tech community is that clique in high school that I just so wanted to be a part of, but I just didn&rsquo;t fit. Learning to program will be my ticket in. I have a strong suspicion that I&rsquo;ll find my people there, perhaps making .</p>

<p>There is a philosophy among Rubyists, minswan. It means &ldquo;Matz (the creator of Ruby) is nice so we are nice.&rdquo; This is also on of the philosophies of the Flatiron School. We are here to learn a language with it&rsquo;s own personality and embedded values.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Malcolm Gladwell&rsquo;s 2008 best seller, <a href="http://gladwell.com/outliers/">Outliers: The Story of Success</a>, he presents his research and conclusions on a common characteristic among successful people. A lot has to do with timing, luck&mdash;being in the right place at the right time.<!-- more --> These things matter too, but practice&mdash;a lot of practice in the craft of choice, is a fundamental requirement to seize the opportunities that serendipity may present.</p>

<p>Even more than 10,000 hours, Gladwell emphasizes that, for those who become true masters of their art, practice ceases to be a chore. It becomes a joy, an obsession, and the central focus of the practitioners life. Work without passion, no matter how many hours logged, will not result in true mastery.</p>

<p>People like to argue about the necessity of this 10,000 hour rule. I have no intention of logging hours towards my goal of becoming a master at my craft. My intention here is to document how I learn to fall in love with my craft, how I frame it in the context of my life to become a passion and a joy, not work that pays my bills.</p>

<p>This is the same philosophy my web development program has chosen. (This is why I chose them.) A quote Avi Flombaum, Dean of <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">Flatiron School</a> used in a recent post that outlines their teaching style captures this spirit perfectly:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you want to build a ship, don’t drum up the men to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea.</p>

<li>Antoine de Saint-Exuprey</li>

<p>My home page still exists at <a href="http://rosiehoyem.com/">rosiehoyem.com</a>, but I&rsquo;ve simplified it significantly. My previous work and blog posts can still be accessed through the <a href="http://rosiehoyem.com/experience-education">Education and Experience</a> tab, but this world is no longer central to this page.</p>

<p>This site will be the new home of my current thoughts and updates about what I am doing.</p>

<p>Change is good. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
